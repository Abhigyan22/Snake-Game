So, after we append the current snake position of snake to snake_list,
it will see if the len(snake_list) increases the snake_size

if it increases, it will delete the 0th index of snake_list(the old position)
and after we eat a food, the snake_size increases by 10..
So, lets consider we ate a food, it will first increase the snake_size by 10
(remember, it is still appending the current position of snake to snake_list)
And then it will see if the len(snake_list) increases snake_size
This time though, it will delete everything except the last 10 elements of snake_list
as snake_size is equal to 10 and then the display_player() func. will draw the snake along
with the tail
